algorithmic analysis

    identify efficient solution - analysing a algorithm helps determine efficiency in terms of time and space complexity
    eanble scalability          - this works even if the data is growing
    optimise system performence - optimise the system performenece
    gide software development   - algorithm analysis helps developers write more efficient and effective code, guides about making the code structure
    ensure predictable behaviour- helps the predictability and reliability of th ealgorithm
    promote innovation          - understanding the strength and weakness of an algorithm through analysis        

    
course outcomes:
    analyse the running times of algorithm
    implement divide and conquer algorithms
    implement optimisation and overlapping


properties of an algorithm
    finiteness      - it should always be finite number of steps
    definiteness    - each step should be precisively defined and leaves no room for interpretation
    input           - the input desired
    output          - the desired output
    effectiveness   - effectiveness of the algorithm

example:
    input - list of tourist attractions with their location, opening and closing

    travel itenerary algorithm:
        - pack all the necessities
        - searching for the best travel destination 
        - sorting the best route so that as much can be visited
        - enjjoy the travel destination
        - search for good restaurants in the destination
        - go back to the home
